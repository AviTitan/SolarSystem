<ul>
<li>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
<li>It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma.
<li> It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud.
<li>The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result.
