<ul>
<li>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.
<li>It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
<li>It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K.
<li>Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.
